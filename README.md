Helps puppet users to find dead code by displaying how many time each class is used.

Classes used 0 time should be removed.


Usage
-----

If you want to read default options and private key from puppet configuration, this gem needs to have root (puppet) permissions.
```
sudo bundle exec puppet-ghostbuster
```

Example output
--------------
```
$ bundle exec puppet-ghostbuster
4 Profiles_c2c::Mw::Lamp
0 Profiles_c2c::Mw::Lighttpd
2 Profiles_c2c::Mw::Mysql
242 Profiles_c2c::Os::Base_debian
132 Profiles_c2c::Os::Monitoring
[...]
```
Wow, we don't seems to use Lightty anymore. Let's do some cleanup.

How It Works
------------
  1. It search puppet code recursively starting from current directory
  2. For each .pp file found, it extract the class name
  3. Query puppetdb (using cache) to find matching class in catalogs
  4. Display the number of class, followed by the class name.
